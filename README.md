## Setting up your Development Environment

You will need an Editor of some sort. The recommendation is to use Visual Studio Code - it is lightweight and free and supports almost every development language.

For more information on setting up your machine, please refer to [Setting up your development environment](./ENVIRONMENT.md).

## Choosing a Development Language

Choose a language you would like to learn. If you have no idea at all which one to choose, here are safe choices:

* Java - Never can go wrong with this. Our key language for building services
* Javascript (Truescript) - There are some doubts whether this really is a programming language. You need it if you want to do Web development
* Python3 - Very universal. Can do anything on any platform. If you are interested in DevOps, try this

For HOWTO's, please refer to the [Working with Git/Gitlab](./GIT.md).

If you need a primer, please ask [Michael](mailto:michael-harald.weber@telekom.de) and we can organize a group session.

## How to Work with this Project

1. **Fork this project** into your personal area. How to do this is explained [here](./GIT.md). You will only have to do this *once*.
2. **Clone your forked project** to your local machine. Also explained on the aforementioned link. You will only have to do this once. <br/>*This is just a fancy way of saying download your code from your forked repository to your local machine.*
3. Work in your editor and create the code for the exercise. 
   * In the folder `exercises` in the root of the project, you will find a folders named `day01` to `day25`.
   * Go to the folder for the day's task you are working on. Inside the folder, you will find a README.md file with a link to the exercise for the day.
   * Create a folder within the day's task folder with your name (i.e. `exercises/day01/yourname`), and create any code within that folder. This folder will be uploaded later, your name identifies your solution for the task.
   * Write your cool code in the language of your choice in your named folder created in the previous step.
   * Once you are happy with the result, submit your answer for the day's task to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). Don't forget to complete the second part of the solution to get the *stars* ⭐️ for the day!
   * Check your score in the [Private Leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private/view/1395439) 🖖 💪
   * Share your code with the team, as explained in the next steps! 👍 ⭐️
4. **Commit** and **Push** your code to your fork. <br/>*This is just a fancy way of saying uploading your changes back to your Gitlab forked project.*
5. **Merge your changes** with the original repo. Explained on the aforementioned link.<br/>*This is a fancy way of saying sharing your code back to the original repository to share your contributions.*.
6. **Pull changes** from the original project back into your forked project (keep in-sync), as explained [here](./GIT.md).
