# Day 4 Exercise

by default the program will execute part 2 on the `rsrc/data.txt` file.    
note that the `rsrc` folder is in the .gitignore, so you need to create the folder and file before executing the program.

to execute part 1 call the program with `p1` as argument.

to use test data call the program with *&lt;test-num&gt;* and it will use the file `rsrc/test`*&lt;test-num&gt;*`.txt` for input.    
note that this comes after the potential `p1/p2` argument.

to build call `make`, to build the interactive version use `INTERACTIVE=1 make` instead.
